Pixel time is a work in progress .  It will be a toy web3 project where people can collaboratively make an animation.  It is meant to be an exploration in a type of voting that seems interesting to me, where people can flip a single bit, and this is either aggregated into a %, or once a certain threshold is reached, it triggers a process.  It could be considered a type of DAO.  Each pixel is an NFT you can control the color of.  With your pixels you can also vote on the future of the canvas by: expanding the canvas, capturing frames, changing the required consensus level, or starting a new era where the canvas will be blanked out and a new animation can begin.

Try it out [here]()

If you have suggestions please feel free to add a PR or issue here.  It's written with [solid-js]() and [solid-bootstrap]() with [vite]() as the tooling/bundler. 

The chat uses [trystero](). 

I'm currently using [truffle]() for the contracts and [web3js]() for the ethereum library, but I plan to eventually move to [ethers]() and [foundry]()
